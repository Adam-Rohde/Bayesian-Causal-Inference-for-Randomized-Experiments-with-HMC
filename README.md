# Bayesian-Causal-Inference-for-Randomized-Experiments-with-HMC

Description: We explore the components of modern model-based Bayesian causal inferenece with a focus on randomized
experiments. We discuss the potential outcomes framework, the Bayesian approach to causal inference,
the MCMC sampling method Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and the Stan probabilistic programming
language. We also work through a simple example to illustrate how these components come together.
